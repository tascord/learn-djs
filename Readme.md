This series, a work in progress at the moment, aims to teach people farmilliar with the concept of, but with little to no experience with programming, how to get started with TypeScript.  
The aim is to get them to go through understanding the basics (data types, objects, functions), and then get them to apply that through the use of the Discord.js library.  
The process of teaching is done through Jupyter Notebooks with a node kernel in Visual Studio Code.  

If you're looking at contributing, go ahead and create a pull request! I'll look through it to make sure we have consistent tone, structure and conventions, then we'll merge your changes.

Thanks for coming along on this journey! While I love to teach I'm still new to it and I'm sure there are many things I won't be able to do justice and I'm hoping that with community support, we can collectively teach some folks!
